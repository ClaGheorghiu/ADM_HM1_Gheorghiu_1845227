# HOMEWORK 1 - HackerRank Python

Student: Claudiu Gabriel Gheorghiu, 1845227

I let the PDF, the .py with HR solutions, .json file and the .ipynb to have a readable code, uploaded in the folder.
I had no programming background in Python, coming from a Management Statistics Bch. We just had some Java in the first year, four years ago.
It was challenging but I gave my best. For the major of the programs I co-worked with my colleagues or asked to my ex ones, trying to understand at max what it was 
happening during the executions. I will implement my computational skills.
